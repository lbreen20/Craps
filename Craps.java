/**
 * The craps program allows a user to play the game craps, in which the rules are as
 * follows:
 * 1. A player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
2. On this first roll, a 7 or an 11 automatically wins, and a 2, 3, or 12 
automatically loses, and play is over. If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are rolled on 
this first roll, that number becomes the "point.‚Äù
3. The player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens: 
either they roll the"point" from that first roll again, in which case they win; or 
they roll a 7, in which case they lose
